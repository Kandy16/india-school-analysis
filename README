If you want to run it and get a feel of how the changes the happened then delete the new-data-set folder and rename old-data-set and run the program in jupyter notebook and see the step by the step process.

The data that we have got

contains the same 'State/UT' column name across all the files
contains 35 states and union territories under that name
contains null values for states whose information is not present


We need to select around 10 around attributes. 
Some of them are
no. of schools
no. of teacheres
no. of students and so on

The above listed need to be normalised against the population of state. I have collected the state population details. I will upload it and will normalize.

Look for other attributes and come up with the ones that we can use.


One approach that we are trying to do is to use Tableau software.

Meanwhile, we are trying to make sure that it is possible to do using web front end technologies.

Looked at the tutorial from the following site which uses leaflet libraries
